# About GenZ Facility Solutions
[GenZ's Website](https://www.genzfacilitysolutions.com)

At GenZFacility Solutions, our story began with a vision to redefine facility management for the modern era. We were fueled by an unwavering passion to revolutionize how businesses interact with their physical spaces. Our founding team comprises a dynamic group of experts who possess extensive knowledge and hands-on experience within the facility management industry.
 
Having worked closely with Fortune 100 corporations and innovative startups, our team understands the diverse needs and complexities that arise in managing facilities of all scales. Through countless interactions with various commercial cleaning and facility management providers, we recognized the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. The status quo simply couldn't keep pace with the rapid advancements in technology and the ever-changing demands of businesses in the 21st century.

## Intro
This is a Web Scraping project is a collaboration with the Co-founders of GenZ Facility Solutions to gather potential clients using a combination of sources. The project uses RAPIDAPI, YelpFusion API, and large CSV files containing business contact information for businesses in the Tri-State area. The information will be gathered to contact business and offer all of the cleaning services that GenZ Facility Solutions offers to commercial and office spaces. This project will mainly gather business emails and business websites. The websites will be used with the SNOV.IO application to scrape emails within that domain. The emails gathered will be used with the REPLY.IO application to automatically reach out to individuals that work or manage the businesses and offer GenZ Facility Solutions' services. In addition, the phone numbers of businesses will also be extracted in an effort to contact businesses through telemarketing.
